Discipline  \\n10.1 Academic Dishonesty \\nA student is assessed in various ways for the award of degree. It is fundamentally \\nimportant that students are assessed fairly. Any attempt  to use unfair means to gain \\nadvantage over another student in the completion of an assessment, or to assist \\nsomeone else to gain an unfair advantage, is considered as academic dishonesty.   All \\nincidents of the use of unfair means must therefore be investigated promptly, \\nthoroughly and fairly.  The basic principle underlying the preparation of any piece of \\nacademic work is that the work submitted must be the student’s own work. Following \\nare considered as unfair means: \\n10.1.1 Plagiarism (either intentional or unintentional) \\nIt is using of ideas or work of another person (including experts and fellow or former \\nstudents or copied from internet) and claiming them as your own. Plagiarism may take \\nthe form of cutting and pasting, taking or closely paraphrasing ideas, passages, \\nsections, sentences, paragraphs, drawings, graphs and other graphical material from \\nbooks, articles, internet sites or any other source and submitting them for assessment \\nwithout appropriate ackn owledgement. Any form of plagrism shall be considered \\ndishonest, unprofessional, unethical and therefore unacceptable. \\nPossible Actions: \\nThe case will be referred to Dean (Academic). Dean (Academic) will refer this case to \\nAPCS for investigation. APCS will submit its recommendations to senate through \\nDean (Academic) and further course of action will be based on Senate decision.  \\n10.1.2 Collusion \\nIt is where two or more  students work together to produce a piece of work, all or part \\nof which is then submitted by eac h of them as their own individual work. This \\nincludes passing on work in any format to another student. Collusion does not occur \\nwhere students involved in group work are encouraged to work together to produce a \\nsingle piece of work as part of the assessment process. \\n10.1.3 Fabrication \\nIt is submitting work (for example, practical or laboratory work) any part of which is \\nuntrue, made up, falsified or fabricated in any way. This is regard ed as fraudulent and \\ndishonest. \\n10.1.4 Unfair means in examination \\nIt is gathering information from any kind of sources (such as mobile phone or bringing \\nduplicates, etc.) or any such attempts, exchange or helping in exchange of information \\nwith others or any such attempts during the examination (quiz, mid semester or end  '),\n",

Bringing a source (such as mobile phone or duplicate, \\netc.) will also be considered under unfair means. \\n10.1.5 Facilitating the use of unfair means.  \\nIt is a kind of unfair means that a  student assists a fellow student in using any of the \\nforms of unfair means defined above, for example in submitting bought or \\ncommissioned work or showing answer to other fellow student during examination, \\netc. \\n10.1.6 Possible Actions (for 10.1.2 to 10.1.5) \\nThe Instructor -in-Charge/ Invigilator of a course shall have the power to debar a \\nstudent from the examination in which the student is detected to be using unfair \\nmeans. Following procedure to be adopted: \\n\\uf0b7 Concern Instruct or-in-charge will investigate the case at his level. If it is in \\nexamination hall, invigilator will submit his report to Instructor-in-charge. \\n\\uf0b7 Instructor-in-charge of the course will call for the written explanation from the \\nstudent and subsequently will decide the level of unfair means and takes a decision \\nout of: \\ni) Level I: Making assessment of that part of the exam zero or Imposing a penalty of \\ndecrease in final grade by one or two grade points or Marking “F” in that \\nparticular course \\nii) Level II: Instructor may refer a more serious case to Dean (Academic),  provided \\nthere is sufficient and clear evidence of use of unfair means.   Claims by the \\nstudent not to have understood the nature of unfair means, to have included the \\nmaterial unintentionally, or to have pe rsonal mitigating circumstances, should not \\nbe accepted as good reason for the case to go unreported.   These may be \\nsignificant issues for the student not the facts of the case. \\n\\uf0b7 In case, the case is referred to Dean (Academic), either investigation will be  done \\nby himself/ herself or a committee constituted by Dean, Academic.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Dean (Academic) will forward/submit its recommendation to the Chairperson \\nSenate for approval.  \\n\\uf0b7 A letter should be sent to the student and her/his parent/ guardian and the case is  \\nrecorded on the file of the student. \\n\\uf0b7 A student found to be involved in use of unfair means may not be eligible to \\nreceive any scholarship/prizes/award from the Institute during the entire period of \\nher/ his programme. \\n10.2 Non-academic Indiscipline \\nThe actions on the students will be taken as per guidelines of SACS.

India, which is going through a rapid \\ngrowth in its manufacturing sector, is not unaffected by these changes. The modern manufacturing \\nenvironment entails a large variety of cross-disciplinary activities including the Design and IT . \\nEngineers consequently are being called upon to work within new environmental, economical and \\nsocial constraints which are increasingly becoming a part of contemporary engineering practice. \\nObviously, these elements need to find their way into the engineering curricula. However, \\ntraditional engineering instructional formats isolate teaching and research into specific disciplines \\nwith un-integrated curricula and therefore the structure of our engineering curricula have hardly \\nchanged in accordance with the modern manufacturing needs. Such divisions in the existing higher \\neducation formats are found to act as barriers to learning, behavior, and performance. \\nAnother aspect of engineering education which needs to be considered is the basic nature of the IT \\nprofession. The IT driven market of today features a model of innovation which is quite different \\nfrom the research models that most institutes are familiar with. The new market model for \\ninnovation emphasizes on fast concept, funds projects with venture capital, fosters innovation by \\nrewarding entrepreneurs who specialize in transforming people's practices to become more \\nproductive with the help of new technology. In contrast, the conventional research model \\nemphasizes on careful development of ideas and principles and achieves innovation only after ideas \\nhave gone through a long pipeline that distills out the best and brings them into practice over a \\nperiod of 15-20 years. This dichotomy between the new market-driven model and the conventional \\nidea-pipeline model poses another great challenge to educators of engineering. \\nThe current engineering education system in India, though huge and diverse, is mainly based on the \\nconventional idea of pipeline model. To integrate the knowledge of a given discipline with IT \\nenabled design, prototyping as well as manufacturing considerations, a need therefore exists for \\ndeveloping a new academic programmes. Apart from laying an emphasis on IT , the new approach \\nshould also give emphasis on aesthetic, ergonomic and functional considerations of products. The \\nacademic programme should also be able to respond to industry driven adaptive management \\nstructure. \\nWith above requirements in mind, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), \\nGovernment of India, felt the need to set up a national institute devoted exclusively for Information \\nTechnology (IT), Design & Manufacturing (D & M). It was envisaged that such an academic institute \\nwould promote excellence in the desired areas of specialization and would facilitate and promote \\nthe competitive advantage of Indian products and manufacturing in global markets. Further, the \\nnew Institute would serve as an inter-disciplinary institution for education and research by keeping \\nthe concept of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in mind. The Indian Institute of Information \\nTechnology, Design & Manufacturing (IIITDM) Jabalpur was thus established in January 2005. Strong \\nindustry interface and close cooperation with other academic and research institutions are the key \\nfeatures of this Institute. \"),\n",

In \\ndoing so the Institute shall identify current and future agendas for scholarship, share knowledge \\nand discoveries with the world community and actively cultivate individuals with the desire and \\ncapability to contribute to society. \\nValues \\nIn planning for its future as well as for conducting its ongoing activities, the Institute seeks to act in \\na manner that is guided by a deep-rooted sense of shared values and aspirations.

Few among them are AMADA, Canon and GE energy. Some students are \\nnow pursuing MS in Japan’s leading academic Institutions, University of Tokyo and Tokyo Institute of \\nTechnology. With the introduction of project based internship (PBI) in the curriculum, in the year \\n2012 five students had been offered six month long internship in MHI, Canon and Chiba University. \\nBased on their performance during internship, the students shall be offered jobs in respective \\ncompanies. \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnual Fest \\nThe students have been organizing annual inter-college festivals namely “Tarang” (Cultural Fest), \\n“Abhikalpan” (Tech Fest) and “Gusto” (Sports Fest) in the campus regularly ever since the inception \\nof the institute.
